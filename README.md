# Garden Share

This is an app for finding shared garden spaces to rent out in your area. You can also see what others in your plot are growing and if they are interested in sharing, selling, buying, or bartering.

### Approach Taken
I created 3 data models (Shared Gardens > Users (Gardeners) > Plants) each nested within the other and learned React.js in the process. I picked 3 simple models that would be good for CRUD and leveraging an external API's.
